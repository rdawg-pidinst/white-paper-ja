Prerequisites for minting DOIs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As a prerequisite to issue DataCite DOIs, your organization needs to
be a DataCite member or work with a DataCite member.  This will
provide you with your own DOI prefix and the access to
`DataCite Fabrica`_ that you will need for
:ref:`datacite-cookbook-minting`.
