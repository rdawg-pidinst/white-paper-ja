"This cookbook enables instrument providers to create `DataCite`_ DOIs as "
"persistent identifiers (PID) for instruments.  DataCite is a global not-for-"
"profit organization that provides DOIs for research data and other research "
"outputs.  The `Persistent Identification of Instruments WG (PIDINST) "
"<pidinst_>`_ has worked with DataCite on the mapping of the PIDINST metadata"
